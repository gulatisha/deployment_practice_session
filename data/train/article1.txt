New Delhi: Nine Al-Qaeda terrorists were arrested this morning as multiple raids were carried out in Kerala and Bengal, the National Investigation Agency (NIA) said. The raids were conducted in West Bengal's Murshidabad and Kerala's Ernakulam.
"NIA had learnt about an inter-state module of Al-Qaeda operatives at various locations in India, including West-Bengal and Kerala.

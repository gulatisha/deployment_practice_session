New Delhi: Bollywood actress Kangana Ranaut is known for her bold and controversial statements, nowadays more so on social media. In a breather of sorts, the Punjab and Haryana High Court gave a clean chit to the actress in a beef row which landed her in trouble. 

The matter is related to an alleged old tweet of the actress about beef-eating, after which a Ludhiana-based Navneet Gopi filed a petition in Punjab and Haryana High Court against Kangana for hurting the religious sentiments.
